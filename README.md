# React Todo App

This repo is an implementation of a Todo app in react.

There are two branches: `master` and `paginator`.
The `master` branch contains a todo list that can be filtered. The `paginator` branch contains a Todo list that
can be filtered and paginated.

The App was initially created with `create-react-app`. It uses `react-bootstrap` for the layout.

## About Tests

There are a couple of tests in `src/components/__tests__`. These are not complete and is only for show casing that the compoments are testable.
